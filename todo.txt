to do now:
final boss
make spear triangular
make miniboss player-targeted attacks glow or something
make mini boss easier



must do before publish:
remove all debug controls
think of a name



unnecessary, but might do:
reload button at the end
find sound effects
change colors between levels
make background less bright?



won't do until post-jam:
make shader outline for player
make custom outlined shader for engine particles
ending screen possibly looping back to the title screen
make some enemies die by multiple attacks
change engine color gradients on forward/backward/stationary movement
change alpha value of visualizer based on intensity of level/music
make noise enemies use a flat shader
change object colors/shaders
make exploded chunks fade away
