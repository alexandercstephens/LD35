to do now:
final boss
make spear triangular
make miniboss player-targeted attacks glow or something



must do before publish:
remove all debug controls
think of a name



unnecessary, but might do:
reload button at the end
make visible checkpoints
find sound effects
make exploded chunks fade away
change colors between levels
make background less bright?
change object colors/shaders
make mini boss wall chunks break away
make noise enemies use a flat shader



won't do until post-jam:
make shader outline for player
make custom outlined shader for engine particles
ending screen possibly looping back to the title screen
make some enemies die by multiple attacks
change engine color gradients on forward/backward/stationary movement
change alpha value of visualizer based on intensity of level/music
